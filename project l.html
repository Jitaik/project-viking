  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>A</strong> hardcore melee action with well designed combat system. The main idea for combat is,
  defeat enemies with adrenaline gage which will be decreased when player doesn't do
  anything but if the player kills enemy or parrys enemys attack then the gage is charged certain amounts.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>P</strong>layer consumes x amount of the gage when player character performs skills which can
  defeat enemies quickly. Managing the adrenaline gage would be the key for combat in this game.</p>
